# MachineLearning :bar_chart:

This repository contains machine learning projects completed during my third year of Computer Science & Biology at McGill University.

## Project Descriptions

### KNNDT: :chart_with_upwards_trend:
Implemented from scratch KNN and DT models to conduct analysis on 2 datasets.
- National Health and Nutrition Health Survey 2013-2014 (NHANES) Age Prediction Subset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin

### Multiclass Regression: :chart_with_upwards_trend:
Implemeneted Multiclass Regression model from scratch. 

Dataset: 20 newsgroups dataset

- Conducted Data preprocessing, vectorization and used Mutual Information to select features.
- Compared multi-label classification performance with Decision Tree (sklearn) performance.
- Performed optimizations for tree depth and classification hyperparameters

### MLP: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Dataset: Sign Language MNIST

- Implementation of three MLP models from scratch
    - (1) MLP with no hidden layer
    - (2) MLP with a single hidden layer and ReLU activations
    - (3) MLP with 2 hidden layers and ReLU activations
 - Applied L2 regularization to MLP with 2 hidden layers
 - Implemented CNN
